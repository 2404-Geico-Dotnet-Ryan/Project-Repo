Individual Users for Guest experience. 
"I want to see the introduction of a User Model (Class / Table) that can have relatively simple fields (Id, Username, Password) ---already exists. Added additional Users to database. 
Create an additional Initial Menu to Login before seeing the Main Menu. Ordering will then need to be tracked however you see fit. 
I will even accept something as incredibly simple as a log that you can recall later to show what any user ordered. 
The simplest version of this could be another Class / Table: Orders/Transactions/Logs (whatever) -> Id, Log 
(just a string of whatever you want to put to tell them later what they ordered)."
